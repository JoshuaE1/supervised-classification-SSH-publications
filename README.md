# Fine-grained-classification-of-social-science-journal-articles-using-textual-data

In this project we develop and evaluate a machine learning module that automatically classifies scientific documents into fine grained  categories (subject specialties).

This repository contains the code used for merging the data and performing the analyses as described in [paper].
